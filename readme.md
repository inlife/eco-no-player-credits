# NoPlayerCredits

## NOTE: published version doesn't support v8.x of the game as of yet.

A simple mod for [Eco](https://ecoauth.strangeloopgames.com/home), that prevents "player credit" currencies from being generated on your server.
Works by blocking automatic currency creation when new players are join to the game first time.

This mod will not remove existing currencies.

Works best on the new, empty world, however make sure to **Mint at least one currency**,
otherwise creating contracts won't work for players (client disconnects), and attempting to create a new law will crash the server.
